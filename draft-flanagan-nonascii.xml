    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>For much of the history of the RFC Series, the character encoding
      used has been US-ASCII. This was a sensible choice at the time: the
      language of the Series is English, a language which only uses
      US-ASCII-encoded characters (ignoring for a moment words borrowed from
      more richly decorated alphabets). US-ASCII is the "lowest common
      denominator" for character encoding, making cross-platform viewing
      trivial.</t>

      <t>There are limits to US-ASCII, however, which hinder its continued use
      as the exclusive character encoding for the Series. The increasing need
      for easily readable, internationalized content suggests it is time to
      allow non-ASCII characters in RFCs where necessary. Given the
      contuinuing goal of maximum readability across platforms, the use of
      non-ASCII should not be gratuitous in a document. This RFC describes the
      rules under which non-ASCII characters may be used in an RFC. These
      rules will be applied as the necessary changes are made to submission
      checking and editorial tools.</t>

      <t/>

      <section title="General usage throughout a document">
        <t>Non-ASCII characters may be used where appropriate, but where
        mentioned, the U+ identifier must be included.</t>

        <t>Example:</t>

        <t>Normalization forms: If the normalization matters to the content,
        the authors must submit in a normalization-resistant form. Do not
        expect normalization forms to be preserved.</t>

      <section title="Author Names">
        <t>Valid Unicode is required, and for non-ASCII names, an ASCII-only
        identifier is required.</t>

        <t>Example:</t>

      <section title="Body of the document">
        <t>Body: Require identifiers, encourage characters, allow unicode
        names.</t>

        <t/>
      </section>

      <section title="Tables">
        <t>Tables: Tables follow the same rules for identifiers and characters
        as the body. If it is sensible (i.e., more understandable for a
        reader) for a given document to have two tables, one including the
        identifiers and characters, one with just the characters, that will be
        allowed on a case by case basis.</t>

        <t>Example:</t>

      <section title="Code components">
        <t>U+ except within a code component where you must follow the rules
        of the programming language in which you are writing the code</t>

        <t>Example:</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Bibliographic text">
        <t>Bibliographic text: The reference must point to something that has
        been translated to English; there must be at least an English language
        title and author. This applies to both normative and informative
        references.</t>
